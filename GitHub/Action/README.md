# SCA Tool - GitHub Action
We are on a mission to make open-source software in products and projects safe, easy, and fun to use.

This is the GitHub-Action to interact with the SCA Tool API and start a scan of your repository automated with workflows.

To get started visist <a href = "https://app.scatool.com">app.scatool.com</a> and create a new project and Distribution Unit. With that you will receive a API-Key that you need to add to your Repository. For ssecurity reasons we recommend to add them as a GitHub-Secret than to write your API-Key directly into the workflow, as it can lead to abuse if it is published.
